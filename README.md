- Centered, elegant UI with brand logo and titles
- Fully responsive: centered card on desktop, full-screen on mobile
- Bootstrap 5 styling with custom message bubbles
- Typing indicator and professional assistant icons
- Optional mock mode (no backend needed for local testing)

**Sample Rest API Payload**

 ```json

  }
 ```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/take-home-exercise.git
cd MyPersonaGen
````

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run in development mode

```bash
npx webpack serve
```

4. Open in browser

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Deployment (S3 + CloudFront)

1. Build for production

```bash
npx webpack --mode production
```

2. Sync to S3

```bash
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://your-bucket-name --acl public-read
```

3. Set up CloudFront for HTTPS and CDN support

## AWS Lex Bedrock Integration (via Lambda)

This app calls Lex using the following synchronous pattern:

```
SPA ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí Lex V2 -> Lambda (Bedrock Guardrails - Toxicity Check) -> bedrock AI
```

## Mock Mode

To test without connecting to AWS:

* Enable mock logic in `ChatComponent.jsx` by simulating responses locally.
* Useful for UI development without backend setup.

# `Back End AWS` 


## Pre Cloudformation Deployment steps

**Note - Before starting stack submission**
 - please configure bedrock guardrails and note 
    - GuardrailId 
    - GuardrailVersion - This will default to 1. But may change in the future.
 - The guardrails should detect and block
    - Toxicity
    - Hate speech
    - Violence
    - Abuse
    - Insults
    - politics
    - religion
    - self-harm
 - The Guardrail should be invoked by the lambda function before sending prompts to claude
 - if the guardrail has Prompt attacks enabled (Enable to detect and block user inputs attempting to override system instructions.), to avoid misclassifying system prompts as a prompt attack and ensure that the filters are selectively applied to user inputs, use input tagging.<br/>

 

 - Configure bedrock with the LLM model of your choice. List of supported models can be round at [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html] .Note the model id for the model of your choice.ClaudeModelId
 - All the lambdas use NodeJs 18 with AWS SDK v3

## CloudFormation Deployment Order (Hybrid Modularization for stacks )


1. iam-stack.yaml
2. ssm-bedrock-config.yaml
3. persona-dynamodb-stack.yaml
3. lambda-stack.yaml
4. stepfunction-stack.yaml
6. api-gateway-stack.yaml

**Configure Amazon Lex post deployment. Lex doesnot yet have full cloudformation support**

## Hybrid Modularization Breakdown: Functional vs. Lifecycle-Aligned Stacks with SSM-Based Inter-Stack Communication

The below table support the use of SSM parameters vs import/export for cross stack communication
| Feature                      | **SSM Parameters**                                       | **CloudFormation Export/Import**                  |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Cross-Stack Referencing      | Flexible (can reference outside of CFN)                  | Works within same region/account                |
| Loose Coupling               | Very loose ‚Äî stacks don‚Äôt depend on each other‚Äôs state   | Tight coupling ‚Äî dependencies at stack level    |
| Stack Updates                | Can update without dependency reordering                 | Must update dependent stacks last               |
| Access Control               | Fine-grained IAM control via `ssm:GetParameter`          | No access control ‚Äî relies on CFN internal refs |
| Dev/Test/Prod Flexibility    | Easy to override with different values                   | Must re-export/import or duplicate              |
| Debugging Simplicity         | Parameters visible in SSM console                        | Harder to trace in CFN UI                       |
| Referencing from Code        | APIs, SDKs, Lambdas can read SSM directly                | Not usable outside CloudFormation               |
| Stack Independence           | Deploy/redeploy in any order                             | Strict deployment order (parent ‚Üí child)        |

### FUNCTION-BASED STACKS:  These group resources by what they do
1. iam-stack.yaml - Roles are foundational and reusable
2. ssm-bedrock-config.yaml - Global system config, centrally defined
3. frontend-stack.yaml - Dedicated to frontend delivery
### LIFECYCLE-BASED STACKS: These group resources based on how often they‚Äôre expected to change
1. lambda-stack.yaml - Lambdas change frequently (logic, models)
2. lex-stack.yaml - Lex needs tuning as you improve UX/NLU

## "Why Choose a Lex Chatbot Over Directly Calling Amazon Bedrock for Your AI Applications?"
But you **should use Lex** when you want:

* Voice interaction
* Guided, multi-step conversation
* Intent/slot routing
* Natural fallback/error handling
* Quick integration with contact centers or support apps

### Lex Advantages

* Lex handles:

  * **Intent classification** (e.g., ‚ÄúGenerate a persona‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù)
  * **Slot filling** (e.g., `CompanyName`, `Characteristics`)
  * **Multi-turn dialogs** (e.g., asking "What are the characteristics?" if missing)

This saves you from writing custom code to parse and manage user input structure.


### 2. **Voice and Multimodal Interfaces**

* Lex is fully integrated with:

  * **Amazon Connect** (voice bots)
  * **Alexa**
  * **Web/mobile SDKs**

If you want your bot available on voice or omnichannel platforms, Lex is plug-and-play.

### 3. **Guardrails, Fallbacks, Re-prompts, and Error Handling**

* Lex provides built-in:

  * FallbackIntent
  * Context-aware dialogs
  * Re-prompting for required slots

You can embed these as safety layers before even reaching Bedrock.

### 4. **Focus Bedrock on the Creativity/Reasoning Layer**

* Let Lex handle structure and user flow.
* Let **Bedrock (Claude)** handle the open-ended language generation:

  * Persona generation
  * Summaries
  * Creative outputs

Each system does what it does best.

### 5. **Analytics, Versioning, and Tuning**

* Lex provides:

  * Analytics (intent success rates, slot dropout)
  * Multiple bot versions
  * A/B testing

You get enterprise-grade chatbot management without building it from scratch
